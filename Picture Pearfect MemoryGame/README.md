<h1> Picture Pearfect MemoryGame </h1> 

<p> A memory game for children between ages 5-10. The idea behind the game is to create an intriguing tool to learn new words in a new language. What's specifik about the game is that we paired pictures with text which provides a great learning opportunity while having fun gaming. Built with Javascript, CSS and HTML. <P>
  
  
<p> The project was used to learn using agile strategies in a group while improving our coding skills. </p>
